                        <p>
                            The evidence of the world has of a soap-like substance dates back to around 2800 BC. The first known creators of this substance were the Babylonians,
                            Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. It wasn't originally made for bathing but for cleaning cooking utensils and medicinal purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All soaps are made from fat, oils and salts. The Babylonians made their soap by boiling fat with ashes. According the Pliny the
                            Elder, the Phoenicians used goat's tallow and wood ashes to create soap in 600BC. Early Romans made soaps in the first century A.D.
                            from urine and soap was widely known in the Roman Empire. The Celts made their soap from animal fat and plant ashes and they named
                            the product saipo, from which the word soap is derived. Today, you still use some type of fat or oil in the soap making process.
                            One of the most common ways to make soap is by combining a fat (either animal or plant) with lye in a process called the
                            cold process method.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the early beginnings of soap making, it was an exclusive technique used by small groups of soap makers.
                            The demand for soap was high, but it was very expensive and there was a monopoly on soap production in many areas.
                            Over time, recipes for soap making became more widely known, but soap was still expensive. Back then, plant byproducts
                            and animal and vegetable oils were the main ingredients of soap. The price of soap was significantly reduced in 1791
                            when a Frenchman by the name of LeBlanc discovered a chemical process that allowed soap to be sold for significantly less money.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            More than 20 years later, another Frenchman identified relationships between glycerin, fats and acid what marked the
                            beginning of modern soap making. With the 1800 discovery of another method of making soap ingredients, soap became even less
                            expensive. Since that time, there have been no major discoveries and the same processes are used for the soap making we use
                            and enjoy today.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next major advancement for soap would be the introduction of liquid soap that we all know today. The first patent of
                            liquid soap was in 1865 by William Shepphard, but became even more popular in 1898 with the introduction of Palmolive.
                            This product, created by B.J Johnson, quickly became the most popular, best selling soap in the world and remains one of
                            the top products to this day.
