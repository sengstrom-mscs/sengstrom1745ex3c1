        <p>
            We are a small woman owed business.
            It started out as a hobby and has grown from there. We now have our own apiary
            that consists of 5 working bee hives.
        </p>
        <p>
            This all started with wanting to try a hand at making old fashioned lye soap. After several failed batches,
            we finally had a successful recipe and our first batch of soap curing in the basement.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that success, we started to play around with adding essential oils and pigments to our basic soap recipe.
            As well as using some different types of oils. Some of our most popular are Rosemary/Mint and our Mango Butter soaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then expanded to add candles to our product line. My husband and I have been raising bees for several years now and
            were wondering what to do with all the wax we get from them. It was a natural to think about doing candles. Again there
            were several failed attempts before we had success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, from failure comes success.
